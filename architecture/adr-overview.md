## What are Architectural Decision Records?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project's lifecycle. They answer the critical question: *"Why did we do it this way?"*

## Why Use ADRs?

ADRs follow the philosophy of "write it down" and provide several key benefits:

### **Consistency and Quality**
- **Architectural Consistency**: Prevents contradictory decisions across teams and eliminates repeated debates
- **Decision Quality**: Forces thorough evaluation of alternatives and trade-offs
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Clear rationale helps teams avoid unnecessary refactoring

### **Knowledge Management**
- **Context Preservation**: Team members understand why decisions were made
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Teams learn from past decisions and avoid losing critical information
- **Decision Traceability**: Track the evolution of your architecture over time

## When to Write ADRs

Document decisions that:
- Impact multiple teams or systems
- Have significant cost implications if changed later
- Involve trade-offs between quality attributes (e.g., performance vs. maintainability)
- Set precedents for future decisions
- Are contentious or had multiple valid options

## Industry Best Practices

- **Keep ADRs Close to Code**: Store in your repository (`/docs/adr/` or `/architecture/decisions/`) so they version with your code
- **Number Sequentially**: Use format like `0001-use-microservices.md`, `0002-choose-database.md`
- **Write When Impact is High**: Focus on decisions that are hard to reverse, affect multiple teams, or have significant cost implications
- **Review as a Team**: ADRs should be discussed and reviewed before being marked as "Accepted"

## Industry Context and Current Adoption

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are experiencing significant growth and adoption in the technology industry. While the concept isn't entirely new, ADRs are gaining substantial traction for several key reasons.

ADRs are becoming increasingly mainstream, with major cloud providers and tech companies actively promoting their use. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all provide dedicated documentation and guidance for ADR implementation, indicating widespread industry acceptance. Major platforms like Backstage (Spotify's developer platform) include built-in ADR support, demonstrating enterprise-level adoption.

### Why ADRs Are Gaining Traction

Several factors drive increased ADR adoption:

**Distributed Teams and Remote Work**: ADRs help maintain clear decision traceability and support effective communication within distributed teams. As remote work became more prevalent in recent years, the need for documented decision-making processes became critical.

**Agile and DevOps Alignment**: ADRs provide transparency and clear visibility of architectural decisions, essential for agile teams that value open communication and information sharing. They align well with modern development practices that emphasize documentation and knowledge sharing.

**Complexity Management**: Modern software systems are increasingly complex, with microservices, cloud-native architectures, and rapid technology changes. ADRs provide essential historical context for architectural decisions, helping teams understand past choices and their consequences.

**Knowledge Retention**: As teams scale and personnel change, ADRs serve as institutional memory, preventing the loss of critical decision context that often leads to repeated mistakes or confusion about system design choices.

The evidence suggests ADRs are transitioning from a niche practice to a standard part of software architecture methodology, driven by the realities of modern software development practices and organizational needs.
